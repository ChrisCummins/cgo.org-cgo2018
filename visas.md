# Visa Information

A visa is required to enter the United States for many nationalities. Please check with your local U.S. embassy/consulate whether this applies to you. In case a visa is required, please apply as soon as possible, as obtaining the visa may take several weeks.

The United States Department of State provides a list of countries that are participants in the Visa Waiver Program here. If you qualify, you will not need a letter.
