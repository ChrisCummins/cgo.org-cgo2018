# Visa Information

Citizens of most countries in the world need a passport valid for at least three months as well as a visa to visit Austria. There are some exceptions:

* Holders of an EEA (EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) or Swiss passport do not require a visa. Citizens of EEA countries can also use an ID card instead of a passport.
* Citizens of countries listed at [this link](http://www.austria.org/visa-application/) (including Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States of America) need no visa for Austria if the stay does not exceed 90 days and is for tourist purposes only. However, there may be specific regulations concerning passport validity, the availability of a return ticket, and so on. Please check with an Austrian embassy in your country.
* Citizens of all other countries need visas. Please contact an Austrian embassy in your country and apply for a visa early. The waiting time can be long and varies from country to country.

Austria is in the Schengen area. Travel visa issued for one Schengen country (i.e., a visa from one of the countries of the Schengen agreement establishing mutual visa recognition between those European countries) are usually valid for all Schengen countries. [More information about Schengen visa can be found here](http://www.immihelp.com/visas/schengenvisa). If you have such a visa (e.g., from attending another conference which is also in the Schengen area), please contact your local Austrian consulate to learn if your Schengen visa is valid for Austria, as well as about all immigration requirements for your trip.
