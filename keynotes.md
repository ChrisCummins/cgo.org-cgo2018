## Biological Computation

**CGO Keynote**

**Speaker:** Sara-Jane Dunn, Scientist, Biological Computation, Microsoft Research Limited

**Abstract:** Unlike engineered systems, living cells self-generate, self-organise and self-repair, they undertake massively parallel operations with slow and noisy components in a noisy environment, they sense and actuate at molecular scales, and most intriguingly, they blur the line between software and hardware. Understanding this biological computation presents a huge challenge to the scientific community. Yet the ultimate destination and prize at the culmination of this scientific journey is the promise of revolutionary and transformative technology: the rational design and implementation of biological function, or more succinctly, the ability to program life.

**Bio:** Sara-Jane Dunn is a Scientist working at the interface of Biology and Computer Science at Microsoft Research, Cambridge. She studied Mathematics at the University of Oxford, graduating with a MMath in 2007. She remained in Oxford for her doctoral research, moving to the Department of Computer Science, where she worked on the development of a computational model of the gut, to investigate the earliest stages of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer. In 2012, she joined Microsoft Research as a postdoctoral researcher, before transitioning to a permanent Scientist role in 2014. At Microsoft, her research focuses on uncovering the fundamental principles of biological information-processing, particularly investigating decision-making in stem cells throughout Development. In 2016, she was invited to become an Affiliate Researcher of the Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, where she collaborates extensively with experimentalists to better understand how to harness the power of these unique cells.
