# Call for Papers
Original contributions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

* Code Generation, Translation, Transformation, and Optimization for performance, energy, virtualization, portability, security, or reliability concerns, and architectural support
* Efficient execution of dynamically typed and higher-level languages
* Optimization and code generation for emerging programming models, platforms, domain-specific languages
* Dynamic/static, profile-guided, feedback-directed, and machine learning based optimization
* Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis for performance, energy, memory locality, throughput or latency, security, reliability, or functional debugging
* Program characterization methods
* Efficient profiling and instrumentation techniques; architectural support
* Novel and efficient tools
* Compiler design, practice and experience
* Compiler abstraction and intermediate representations
* Vertical integration of language features, representations, optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism
* Solutions that involve cross-layer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design and integration
* Deployed dynamic/static compiler and runtime systems for general purpose, embedded system and Cloud/HPC platforms
* Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures
* Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA
* Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization
